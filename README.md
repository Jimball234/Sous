Problem Statement

Sous is an application that aims to allow users to add ingredients to their virtual fridge/freezer/pantry
along with the count and expiration dates for a way to track their groceries. The user can then get 
recommended and personalized AI-generated recipes based on user-inputted specifications as well as specify on the web page
whether they wish to use solely the items in their virtual pantry/fridge. On the recipe selection page, the user will be prompted
six different diverse recipe options and upon choosing one of the recipes, users may choose to speak or type out concerns and questions
about any step throughout the recipe. The AI will be able to provide on-the-fly solutions to errors or hiccups the user 
might encounter during the execution of the cooking process.

Accessing Application
